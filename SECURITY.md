# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, **do not open a
public issue or pull request.** Report it directly to Rickard Nisses-Gagnér
(<rickard@nisses-gagner.se>), the project owner.

<!-- If your organisation has a central security function and coordinated vulnerability
     disclosure (CVD) process, point at it here rather than inventing a parallel one — see
     the worked example this file was drawn from, which withheld the real contact details
     until its formal governance process completed, and tracked that explicitly as a gap. -->

## Coordinated vulnerability disclosure

<!-- If CVD is owned centrally by your organisation's security function, say so and link
     the relevant methodology chapter or policy instead of authoring your own. -->

This repository does not run a separate disclosure process; it follows the organisation's
central one.

## `security.txt`

<!-- If you publish a machine-readable security.txt (RFC 9116) at
     /.well-known/security.txt, note where it's served from. If you don't yet, say so and
     track it as a gap rather than silently having none. -->

## Secrets and configuration

- Secrets are never committed. `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` (repo root) lists the
  required keys with no values.
- Deployment secrets are stored as CI/CD platform secrets (see `README.md`).
- If a secret is ever exposed, it is treated as compromised: rotate it immediately, then
  clean history. See
  [`docs/development/secrets-rotation.md`](docs/development/secrets-rotation.md) and
  [`docs/methodology/c-sakerhet/hantering-av-hemligheter.md`](docs/methodology/c-sakerhet/hantering-av-hemligheter.md).
